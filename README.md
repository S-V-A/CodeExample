# CodeExample
Simple project to demonstrate coding skills.

It is a primitive game framework that supports saving/loading of game data.

It has a basic item class, representing world item. There are equippable and non-equippable items. Framework has storage that contains all items that don`t belong to player. Player class is a container for inventory and equipment.

Application has one player and simple GUI that supports adding/removing items to/from player inventory and equipment.

There is also a simple save system that allows us to save and load the state of the game. State is saved upon change and is called separately for storage, eqipment and inventory.

p.s. there is no commit history because it was copied from another source.
